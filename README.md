I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the core Java module, where I acquired a comprehensive understanding of fundamental Java concepts. Building upon this knowledge, I recently undertook the task of developing two practical applications, namely a Vehicle Management Application using ArrayLists and a Banking Application using HashMaps.

The Vehicle Management Application leverages the dynamic capabilities of ArrayLists to efficiently store and manipulate collections of vehicle objects. By implementing various concepts covered in the module, such as enums, exception handling, serialization, deserialization, and validation,   Enums were utilized to represent a predefined set of vehicle types, while exception handling mechanisms were incorporated to gracefully handle unforeseen errors or exceptional situations. Furthermore, I implemented serialization and deserialization techniques to facilitate the storage and retrieval of object data. Lastly, I integrated validation mechanisms to guarantee the correctness and integrity of user input, enhancing the reliability of the application.

Similarly, the Banking Application employs the key-value pairing functionality of HashMaps to efficiently manage customer accounts.
